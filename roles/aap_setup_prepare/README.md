# aap\_setup\_prepare

A role to prepare the installation of AAP 2.x, installing pre-requisites,
unpacking the installation tarball and (optionally) writing the necessary inventory file.

## Requirements

* The installer tarball must be available, by default downloaded with the `aap_setup_download` role.
* The (RPM) pre-requisites must have been installed, or root access must be given.

## Role Variables

The following input variables are available:

|Variable Name|Default Value|Required|Description|Example|
|---:|:---:|:---:|:---|:---:|
|`aap_setup_prep_installer_file`|"`{{ aap_setup_down_installer_file }}`"|no|absolute path where to find the tarball on the remote host, or URL http(s), note that `aap_setup_down_installer_file` is a fact set by the role `aap_setup_download`|'https://myhost/myinstaller.tar.gz' or '/var/tmp/myinstaller.tar.gz'|
|`aap_setup_prep_working_dir`|"`{{ aap_setup_working_dir | default('/var/tmp') }}`"|no|absolute path to a working directory, note that `aap_setup_working_dir` is used by other roles in the collection|'/srv/workdir'|
|`aap_setup_prep_process_template`|true|no|shall the inventory be generated by the role?|false|
|`aap_setup_prep_inv_nodes`|none|yes|a dictionary of dictionaries, the first level key is the inventory group name, the 2nd level key is the hostname with the value being its inventory host variables in INI-format|see [defaults/main.yml](defaults/main.yml)|
|`aap_setup_prep_inv_vars`|{}|see below|a dictionary of dictionaries, the first level key is the inventory group name, the 2nd level key is the variable name with the value being the variable's value|see [defaults/main.yml](defaults/main.yml)|
|`aap_setup_prep_inv_secrets`|{}|see below|a dictionary of dictionaries, the first level key is the inventory group name, the 2nd level key is the variable name with the value being the variable's value|see [defaults/main.yml](defaults/main.yml)|

Some notes about the inventory variables and secrets:

* both values will be combined (the secrets overwriting the variables) and used to generate the installation inventory, so that secret variables can be defined separately for example in a vault.
* even if formally both variables don't need to be defined, you'll get a viable inventory only if you define some keys/variables at least in the group `all`.
By convention the [defaults/main.yml](defaults/main.yml) contains all possible variables as comments, the variables commented out _twice_ are truly optional.

## Dependencies

* `aap_setup_download`, in the same collection, can be used to download the tarball automatically.

## Example Playbook

```yaml
- name: download and install AAP from the bastion
  hosts: bastion
  gather_facts: false
  become: false
  tags: aap_installation
  roles:
    - redhat_cop.aap_utilities.aap_setup_download
    - redhat_cop.aap_utilities.aap_setup_prepare
    - redhat_cop.aap_utilities.aap_setup_install
```

Note that this only works without root access if the bastion host isn't part of the future cluster,
and if the RPM pre-requisites have been pre-installed.
Else change to `become: true`.
